    Full Visual Web Development Tools
<p>　　There are many visual development tools on the market, such as Microsoft Visual Studio, Dreamweaver, eclipse and so on. But all of these tools focus on code programming, and are clearly inadequate in visualization. For example, Dreamweaver is the best platform for visual design, but it still can't be fully visualized, that is to say, the design interface is completely different from what the actual user sees on the browser. In the design process, the programmer can only modify the code through the code editor, and then open a browser to see the actual operation of the effect in the browser. It's time consuming, laborious and error prone, and it doesn't guarantee the program to work properly on other browsers.</p>
<p>　　So, is there a visual, WYSIWYG web development tool that can be fully visualized? Below, I  recommend a full visualization of the site dev tool --ePage.</p>
<p>　　Let's take a look at the ePage design interface, the design VS result, and the performance on a variety of browsers.</p>

<p>　　See here, I believe that we have been able to feel the powerful features of ePage, right?. The design of a fast visual interface, can run in a variety of environments, while maintaining a highly consistent interface, for most Web programmers, especially for beginners, using ePage developers with fast page is the most appropriate.</p>

<p>　　The following I to introduce some of the other features of ePage.</p>
<img src = "https://github.com/x3titan/ePage/blob/master/res/ePage005.jpg?raw=true">
<p>　　One-click skin for controls. A pile of skin can choose, but also according to their own needs in the Internet to find pictures, import their own skin.
<p>　　The skin can be HSI transform, is popular in terms of color, programmers do not have to find the love of the skin but don't take that tone.
<p>　　Screen adaptation function: in different browser window size, especially different types of mobile phones, the page can be designed as dynamic size, while the font can also be dynamically adjusted according to the size of the screen. These complex functions can be accomplished with just one-click.

<p>　　EPage not only allows quick production of front-end pages, but also provides exceptionally powerful back-end development. Since the programmer does not have to worry about the interaction of Ajax, data packaging, or WebService functions and so forth, ePage provides a one-stop, non refresh page data interaction technology. As long as the programmer needs to use a unified JS code (stresses that both front-end and back-end can use JS code), database access, or WebService access, and so on. Greatly simplifies the complexity of the program, increasing the maintainability of the code, allowing programmers to have more energy to focus on business logic.

<p>　　Openness: the JS page of the bar chart report, which was developed by ePage to introduce the Baidu chart control, shows that ePage is a fully open platform that facilitates the import of a wide variety of web code.
    <img src = "https://github.com/x3titan/ePage/blob/master/res/ePage008.jpg?raw=true">
<p>　　In addition to the standard controls, ePage also provides a variety of material and control resources to facilitate copy and paste to your own page.
<p>　　Finally, I'll introduce ePage application: mainly is the development of Web, there are other: web design, web development, database design, App design (of course is to pack the H5 page), website development, website design, web development tools, web page design visualization development tools, development tools, visual programming etc..
<p>　　EPage more suitable for beginners to use, for small companies want to invest relatively little manpower to do a big project, ePage is also a good choice.
